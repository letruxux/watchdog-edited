## Python and packages.
First, download this project using the Code > Download ZIP and extract the ZIP.

This code is written in python, so you need it to run the code. I recommend installing [Python 3.11 from the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NRWMJP3717K), because that's what i used to write it.

After installing python, you have to **install the packages** using the requirements.txt file.
To do that, open command prompt and go in the extracted folder from before using the `cd` command. 
Example: `cd C:\Users\balls\Downloads\watchdog\`

After changing the directory, do the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the needed packages.

## Run on startup
First, press Win + R and type `shell:startup` to open the startup folder.
Next, drag the edited python file.
